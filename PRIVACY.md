# Privacy Policy for Inkling

**Last updated:** December 21, 2024

## Overview

Inkling is a **local-first** note-taking and calendar application. Your privacy is our priority - all your data stays on your device.

## Data Storage

### Local Data
All of the following data is stored **locally on your device only**:
- Notes and documents
- Calendar events
- Folders and organization
- Application settings
- Conversation history with AI features

**We do not operate any servers that store your personal data.**

## Google Calendar Integration

When you optionally connect Google Calendar:

### What We Access
- **Read-only access** to your Google Calendar events
- Your Google account email (to display connection status)

### How We Use It
- Calendar events are synced to your **local database only**
- Events are displayed within the Inkling calendar view
- You can create notes linked to calendar events

### What We Don't Do
- We do not store your Google data on external servers
- We do not share your calendar information with third parties
- We do not modify or delete events on your Google Calendar

### Credential Storage
- Google OAuth tokens are stored locally in your application database
- Tokens are used only to maintain your calendar sync
- You can disconnect your Google account at any time from Settings

## AI Features

If you use AI-powered features (chat, summarization, etc.):
- AI requests are sent directly to your configured AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- We do not proxy or store these requests
- Your API keys are stored locally on your device
- Review your AI provider's privacy policy for their data handling practices

## Analytics & Tracking

- Inkling does **not** include any analytics or tracking
- We do not collect usage statistics
- We do not use cookies or tracking pixels

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share any of your data with third parties because we do not have access to your data.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally:
- **Access**: Your data is in the application's local database
- **Deletion**: Uninstalling the app removes all local data
- **Portability**: Your notes are stored in standard formats

## Children's Privacy

Inkling does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
